Optics are a tool employed in functional programming to zoom into nested data structures. They are designed for composability, allowing you to create complex operations step-by-step by composing simple components. Optics also never modify their input data structures, ensuring your objects stay nice and immutable.

Giulio Canti's [monocle-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/monocle-ts) library is a TypeScript port of Scala's [Monocle](https://julien-truffaut.github.io/Monocle/) library, which in turn is inspired by Haskell's [Lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) library. It provides "a highly generic toolbox for composing families of getters, folds, isomorphisms, traversals, setters and lenses and their indexed variants."

In this first article, we'll use two optics: lenses and optionals. In the next article, we'll dive deeper into traversals, isomorphisms, and prisms.

We'll use the [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) library for defining the types for our examples. Using `io-ts` is a small detour, but I think it's useful to understand how it can work together with `monocle-ts`.

The code for this tutorial can be found from [monocle-ts/](https://github.com/ksaaskil/functional-programming-examples/tree/master/monocle-ts) folder of [this repository](https://github.com/ksaaskil/functional-programming-examples).

## Getting started with `io-ts`

`io-ts` is a run-time type system. It allows you to add run-time type-checking to those pesky `Any` objects you get from external sources like user inputs, files, or databases. Let's consider a simple `Hobby` interface defined as follows:

```ts
interface HobbyI {
  name: string;
}
```

The way to define this in `io-ts` is as follows:

```ts
import * as t from "io-ts";
const HobbyT = t.interface({ name: t.string });
type Hobby = t.TypeOf<typeof HobbyT>; // Static type
```

I use the `T` extension to mark `io-ts` types. It's important to notice that the `HobbyT` is a `const` and not a type: it's an object that remembers its properties even after the `TypeScript` code is transpiled to JavaScript. Therefore, one can use the `HobbyT` object at _run-time_ to check if objects are actually valid hobbies or not.

`Hobby`, on the other hand, is a static type equivalent to `type Hobby = { name: string }`. `Hobby` is a pure TypeScript thing and does not exist anymore after transpilation.

`HobbyT` has an `is` method you can use to check if objects are valid hobbies:

```ts
it("accepts an valid hobby object as HobbyT", () => {
  const isHobby = HobbyT.is({ name: "Photographing corgis" });
  expect(isHobby).toBe(true);
});
it("does not accept an invalid hobby object as HobbyT", () => {
  const isHobby = HobbyT.is({ name: 66 });
  expect(isHobby).toBe(false);
});
```

For more stringent validation and error messages, you can use `decode`:

```ts
import { isLeft, isRight } from "fp-ts/lib/Either";

it("can decode a hobby from valid input", () => {
  const maybeHobby = HobbyT.decode({ name: "Petting corgis" });
  expect(isRight(maybeHobby)).toBe(true);
});
it("does not decode a hobby from invalid input", () => {
  const maybeHobby = HobbyT.decode({ name: 67 });
  expect(isLeft(maybeHobby)).toBe(true);
});
```

`decode` method returns an [Either](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Either.ts.html) object, whose value can be "left" or "right" corresponding to either failure or success, respectively. If there's an error, the either contains a "left" of `t.Errors` type defined as follows:

```ts
export interface Errors extends Array<ValidationError> {}
```

Validation errors can be printed with, for example, the [PathReporter](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts#error-reporters) utility. You can read more about the `Either` type in my [previous article on `fp-ts`](https://dev.to/ksaaskil/using-fp-ts-for-http-requests-and-validation-131c).

Here are the rest of the types we'll need:

```ts
const PersonT = t.interface({
  firstName: t.string,
  age: t.number,
  hobbies: t.array(HobbyT),
});
type Person = t.TypeOf<typeof PersonT>;

const BandT = t.interface({ name: t.string, members: t.array(PersonT) });
type Band = t.TypeOf<typeof BandT>;

// type Artist = Person | Band;
const ArtistT = t.union([PersonT, BandT]);
type Artist = t.TypeOf<typeof ArtistT>;
```

`Person` is an object with `firstName`, `age` and an array of hobbies. A band is an object with `name` and `members`, where `members` is a list of persons. Finally, `Artist` is defined as being either a single person or a band.

We also define a few objects:

```ts
const elvis: Person = {
  firstName: "Elvis",
  age: 100,
  hobbies: [
    {
      name: "singing",
    },
  ],
};

const metallica: Band = {
  name: "Metallica",
  members: [
    {
      firstName: "James",
      hobbies: [],
      age: 56,
    },
    {
      firstName: "Lars",
      hobbies: [],
      age: 55,
    },
    {
      firstName: "Kirk",
      hobbies: [],
      age: 57,
    },
    {
      firstName: "Robert",
      hobbies: [],
      age: 55,
    },
  ],
};

const artists: Artist[] = [elvis, metallica];
```

Elvis is a single person and Metallica is a band, together they form the `artists` array.

## Lenses

We'll start with [Lens](https://gcanti.github.io/monocle-ts/modules/index.ts.html#lens-class), which is a composable getter and setter. The signature in `monocle-ts` is

```ts
export class Lens<S, A> {
  constructor(readonly get: (s: S) => A, readonly set: (a: A) => (s: S) => S) { ... }
  ...
}
```

We see that the constructor takes a getter and a setter as input arguments. Type variables `S` and `A` stand for the "source" and "target" types, respectively. The getter consumes a source of type `S` and produces an instance of `A`. The setter is a curried function taking a new value `a` of type `A` and a source object `S` and it returns a new object of type `S`.

Lenses can be created by defining which objects they operate on and the target field. Here's a full example of a lens `personToName` of type `Lens<Person, string>`:

```ts
const personToName: Lens<Person, string> = Lens.fromProp<Person>()("firstName");
```

Type signature `Lens<Person, string>` means that the lens operates on objects of type `Person` and targets a field of type `string`. Lens is created with the static [Lens.fromProp](https://gcanti.github.io/monocle-ts/modules/index.ts.html#fromprop-static-method) method. It requires explicitly setting the type variable `Person`, but it can infer the field type `string` from the type of the field `firstName`. Other ways to create lenses from scratch are the static [fromPath](https://gcanti.github.io/monocle-ts/modules/index.ts.html#frompath-static-method), [fromProps](https://gcanti.github.io/monocle-ts/modules/index.ts.html#fromprops-static-method) and [fromNullableProp](https://gcanti.github.io/monocle-ts/modules/index.ts.html#fromnullableprop-static-method) methods of the `Lens` class.

The lens getter `(p: Person) => string` can be accessed via `get` property:

```ts
const getName: (p: Person) => string = (p: Person) => personToName.get(p);
expect(getName(elvis)).toEqual("Elvis");
```

Here's how you could use the `personToName.set` as a setter:

```ts
const setName: (newName: string) => (p: Person) => Person = personToName.set;
const setJillAsName: (p: Person) => Person = setName("Jill");
const modified: Person = setJillAsName(elvis);
expect(modified).toHaveProperty("firstName", "Jill");
expect(elvis).toHaveProperty("firstName", "Elvis"); // Unchanged
```

Note that `elvis` object remains intact as the setter always creates a new copy of the argument.

With the `modify` method you can create a setter that modifies fields with the given function:

```ts
const upperCase = (s: string): string => s.toUpperCase();
const upperCasePersonName: (p: Person) => Person = personToName.modify(
  upperCase
);
const elvisUpperCased = upperCasePersonName(elvis);
expect(elvisUpperCased).toHaveProperty("firstName", "ELVIS");
```

This all nice and good, but the true power of optics becomes clearer when you start to compose them. We'll see examples of this soon when introducing new optics.
