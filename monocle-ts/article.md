# Fun with optics: monocle-ts ‚ù§ OpenAPI

Optics are a composable way to access and transform complex structures. By a complex structure, I mean something like an [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) for [Stripe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stripe/openapi/master/openapi/spec3.yaml). When working with huge objects like that, you don't want to find yourself writing stuff like `schema.paths["/"].post.responses['200']` too often. Instead, you want to add a layer of abstraction on top of the schema that lets you create complex accessors and transformations by composing simple ones.

That's where optics such as lenses come in. In this article, I'll go through practical examples of using [monocle-ts]() to work with a complex data structure. Other lens libraries include [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) for Haskell, [monocle](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle) for Scala, and [python-lenses](https://github.com/ingolemo/python-lenses).

As I'm not an expert on optics, I won't try to go into detail in this article. If you want to learn more about optics, I have found the following resources useful:

You can find the full code for the examples below in [this repository](https://github.com/ksaaskil/functional-programming-examples/tree/master/monocle-ts).

## Quick tour of OpenAPI

As an example data structure, we'll use an OpenAPI specification. OpenAPI defines the operations supported by a RESTful API. For the purposes of this article, it is sufficient to use the following, simplified representation of OpenAPI specification:

```ts
export interface OpenAPI {
  openapi: string;
  info: Info;
  paths: Paths;
  servers?: Array<Server>;
}

export interface Info {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  version: string;
}

export type Paths = Record<string, PathItem>;

export interface PathItem {
  summary?: string;
  description?: string;
}

export interface Server {
  url: string;
}
```

As an example object, we'll use a [simplified](https://github.com/ksaaskil/functional-programming-examples/blob/master/monocle-ts/stripe-simple.yaml) version of the Stripe [OpenAPI specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stripe/openapi/master/openapi/spec3.yaml):

```yaml
# stripe-simple.yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  contact:
    email: dev-platform@stripe.com
  description:
    The Stripe REST API. Please see https://stripe.com/docs/api for more
    details.
  title: Stripe API
  version: "2019-11-05"
servers:
  - url: https://api.stripe.com/
paths:
  /v1/account:
    get:
      description: "<p>Retrieves the details of an account.</p>"
      operationId: GetAccount
      responses:
        "200":
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/account"
          description: Successful response.
        default:
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/error"
          description: Error response.
components:
  schemas:
    account: ... # Removed for brevity
    error: ...
```

If you copy-paste the YAML from the repository to [Swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/), you can see a pretty online documentation for the API.
