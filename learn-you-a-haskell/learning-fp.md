This is the first part of the series on learning functional programming (FP). Inspired by [100 days of FP](https://dev.to/gillchristian/day-12-lambda-calculus-29hg), I'm also writing this series as my personal notes of my progress in learning FP. I do not claim to be an expert in FP, so if you think anything I write is inaccurate or plain wrong, please let me know in the comments!

In this first part, I'd like to share my motivation on learning functional programming (FP) and why I think Haskell is the perfect language for learning FP.

Let me start with a confession. In my whole (admittedly short) career in professional software development, I've never written a single line of code in Haskell, and I probably never will. In a previous job, I did write a lot of code in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), but I think my code was closer to "concise Java with maps and flatmaps" than code you'd see in Haskell. Despite that, I think starting to learn functional programming was one of the most useful things I could have done for my career. Here's why I think so.

### Why functional programming

### 1. It brings math to programming

The first reason I like functional programming is that to me, it brings me math back to programming. At the university, I minored in match. I'll probably never have practical use to my courses in topology, differential geometry, measure theory or group theory, but I don't think any of those courses were waste of time. They all taught me a lot about the power of abstraction, how to find and see the big concepts underlying seemingly unrelated problems.

In functional programming, you encounter abstractions all the time. While you may not need to know what a functor is to  Functional programming has roots deep in category theory, a branch of mathematics studying objects and their relationships. Learning category theory is in no way required for learning functional programming, but being quite an analytical person, I love learning theory. 

At the university, my major was in physics and minor in mathematics. Being a very analytical person, I've missed those days of sitting down with theory books in my career in software development. Learning functional programming concepts such as monoids, monads, functors, and applicative functors has forced me to slow down and sit down with pen and paper.

### 2. It teaches you to think differently

Most of us learn imperative programming at school, using constructs such as if-clauses and for-loops. Therefore, when you suddently can't use such imperative constructs, your program will inevitably look quite different. I think that's a very good thing, as it's good to have multiple  solutions to the same problem available in your toolbox so you can pick the one most suited for your situation.

### 3. FP is good programming style

I think functional programming is the logical conclusion to many ideas considered good programming style. Avoiding side effects, favoring immutable objects, and using composition instead of, for example, inheritance to achieve code re-use are principles built-in to functional programming. Don't get me wrong: at work I still write functions with side effects (logging, analytics events, etc.) or use mutable objects (for, e.g., complex data structures). In my experience, however, favoring functional code typically results in easier-to-read and modular code. It's interesting to learn how far you can push such ideas.

## Why Haskell?

### 1. Haskell is lingua franca

### 2. Haskell is purely functional

### 3. Haskell has a powerful type system

This is the first part of the series on learning functional programming (FP). Inspired by [100 days of FP](https://dev.to/gillchristian/day-12-lambda-calculus-29hg), I'm also writing this series as my personal notes of my progress in learning FP. I do not claim to be an expert in FP, so if you think anything I write is inaccurate or plain wrong, please let me know in the comments!

In this first part, I'd like to speak about types. I'll use [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) in the code snippets below. While I've never used Haskell in my working career in software development (and probably won't), I think Haskell is the best language to learn functional programming concepts. Being a pure functional language, Haskell won't let you "cheat" by reverting to imperative programming. There are also wonderful resources for learning Haskell such as the [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction) book available for free.

I'll use the [GHCi](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.html), the interactive environment of the [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) Haskell compiler to explore types. If you'd like to follow along, you can install Haskell with [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and enter

```bash
$ stack ghci
```

to enter the `ghci` REPL.

## Types of values

In programming, we typically deal with two kinds of objects: values and types. In Haskell interpreter, we can use `:t` to print types of values as follows:

```
ghci> :t True
True :: Bool
```

Haskell says that the inferred type of `True` is `Bool`, a boolean. `Bool` is defined in the [`Prelude`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Prelude.html) module imported by default.

Tuples are defined by parentheses:

```
ghci> :t (True, False)
(True, False) :: (Bool, Bool)
```

Function `fst` can be used to extract the first component from a pair (a tuple of two elements). In Haskell, function is invoked by putting the arguments after the function name, without parentheses:

```
ghci> myPair = (True, False)
ghci> fst myPair
True
```

What is the type of function `fst`?

```
ghci> :t fst
fst :: (a, b) -> a
```

Here, `a` and `b` are so-called _type variables_. They represent any type, a bit like _generics_ in languages such as Java.

As another example of function, consider `&&`, the `AND` operator familiar from most programming languages. When you write the following in Haskell, 

```
ghci> True && False
False
```

you're actually evaluating the function `(&&)` with two arguments, `True` and `False`. In Haskell, functions consisting of only special characters are considered _infix_ functions by default, meaning that the function should be sandwiched between its arguments. The parentheses are required for examining the type or calling it as a prefix function: 

```

ghci> (&&) True False
False
```

Parentheses are also required if calling the functions as a prefix ("normal") function:

```
ghci> :t (&&)
(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
```

## Typeclasses

What is the type of `2`? Let's see:

```
ghci> :t 2
2 :: Num p => p
```

What does this mean? Haskell says that the inferred type of `2` is `p`, where `p` is a so-called _type variable_. A type variable represents any type satisfying the _class constraints_ on the left side of `=>`. In this case, the class constraint is  `Num p`, meaning that the type `p` belongs to the _typeclass_ `Num`.

Here's another example:

```
ghci> :t [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3] :: Num a => [a]
```

Now, Haskell says that the inferred type of `[1, 2, 3]` is a list of type variable `a`, where `a` again has the type constrain that it belongs to the `Num`.  

## Kind

I'll cite following on the Wikipedia article on [kinds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_%28type_theory%29):

> In the area of mathematical logic and computer science known as type theory, a kind is the type of a type constructor or, less commonly, the type of a higher-order type operator.

```ghci
ghci> :k []
[] :: * -> *
```

```
ghci> :k Maybe
Maybe :: * -> *
```

```ghci
ghci> :k Functor
Functor :: (* -> *) -> Constraint
```
